I get bits of inspiration from many places but these sites below are the main reason my current site looks the way it does. </p> <p> So, in no specific order: </p> </section> <section> <h4 class="center">DevArt with Google</h4> <img class="small-image-wrapper left" src="images/devart.png" alt="dev art with google"> <p> If you ever been to the <a href="https://devart.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank"> DevArt website</a> you will instantly see similarities between my site and their's.

I loved there work so much I decided to try out threeJS (a popular webGl library), and with the help of the many basic examples and tutorials I was able to come up with a minimalistic style design that works well for the background of my website. I'm nowhere near producing the stunning work similar to the Active Theory team, so I will continue to look up to them and embrace their craftsmanship and values. </p> </section> </div> </div> </div> <div ng-include="'./components/footer.html'"></div> </div> <div id="back2top"> <div class="arrow-up"></div> </div>
